      <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a
          Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
        <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school to save more money. Works in the Civillian Corps, helping
          starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
        <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
        <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries a wife of 69 years Margaret Gibon. Gets laid off due to budgets cuts,
          inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school to study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
          pest-resistent plants.</li>
        <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead,
          the militaryasked his lab to work on waterproof glue ,DDT to control malaria, disinfection, and ither applied
          science.</li>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Recieves a Ph.D in Genetics and Planr Pathology</li>
        <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupunt, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and
          flies to Mexico to head a new Plant Pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
          strain of disease resistant wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth</li>
        <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
        <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high yielding American breed,
          creating a strain that respondes well to fertilizer. It goes on to produce 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
        <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
          subcontinent in time to help migrate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - Recieves the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven Africa countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
        </li>
        <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguised professor at A&M University</li>
        <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
          modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says GM crops are not
          inherently dangerous because "we've been gentically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before
          we called in science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
      </ul>
